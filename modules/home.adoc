== What is Cake Walk?
The Cake Walk course is an introductory skill building course where you can build a simple Alexa skill (Cake Walk skill) which remembers your birthday. On repeated usage of the Cake Walk skill, you'll either hear a Happy Birthday message from Alexa, or a countdown of days until it is your birthday. In this course, we are going to add visuals and animations to teach the fundamentals of https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-presentation-language/understand-apl.html[building with APL, window=_blank]. If you are new to skill building, we recommend you check out the {link-cakewalk}, but if you are already building Alexa skills or are already familiar with the concepts, then keep reading! Code for the Cake Walk skill and instructions to set the skill up will be provided later in the course if you need it.
